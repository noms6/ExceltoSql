1. Project Purpose and Scope
This project is an application built using C# and .NET that aims to automatically transfer data from Excel files to a SQL database. When a user uploads a specific Excel file, the system reads the data and inserts it into an SQL table. This process provides a faster and error-free transfer compared to manual data entry.

Excel is frequently used in areas like data analysis, large-scale business processes, and reporting. However, transferring this data to SQL is often complex and time-consuming. This project automates this process, enabling users to integrate data directly into SQL.

2. Technologies Used in the Project
The project primarily utilizes the following technologies:

C# (C Sharp): The main programming language used for developing the application.
.NET Framework: The framework used for building the application.
EPPlus or NPOI Libraries: Popular libraries used for processing Excel files.
SQL Server: The database management system where data is stored.
ADO.NET: A library used for connecting to SQL and performing data insertion operations.
These components facilitate reading data from Excel and securely transferring it to SQL.

3. Workflow of the Project
The system operates through the following steps:

1. Selecting the Excel File:
The user uploads an Excel file through the interface.
Supported formats typically include .xlsx and .xls.
2. Reading the Data:
Libraries like EPPlus or NPOI are used to read the data from the Excel file.
The system analyzes the column structures in the Excel file.
3. Creating the SQL Table:
If the SQL table for the data does not exist, the system can automatically create it.
If the table already exists, it checks whether the columns are compatible.
4. Transferring Data to SQL:
Bulk Insert or ADO.NET single-row insertion techniques are used to insert the data into SQL.
For large datasets, efficiency-enhancing techniques (e.g., bulk data insertion) are applied.
After this process, the user successfully transfers all the data from Excel to SQL.

4. Code Structure Analysis
The project includes the following main code components:

ExcelReader.cs → Class for reading the Excel file and parsing the data.
DatabaseManager.cs → Class for connecting to the SQL database and processing the data.
Program.cs → Main code that handles the program flow.
These structures ensure that the code is modular, improving its readability and maintainability.

5. Academic Evaluation and Contributions
This project is a significant application in the fields of data engineering and database management. It is particularly beneficial in large-scale data transfer scenarios, where it helps to avoid manual entry errors, reduce processing time, and provide automation.

Such systems:

Accelerate business processes.
Facilitate large-scale data integrations.
Provide user-friendly solutions.
Moreover, in an academic context, it contributes to data integration and automation, enhancing the efficiency of systems that work with SQL.
